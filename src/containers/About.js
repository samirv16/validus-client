            There are times in life getting to the gym isn't realistic. 
            We all have busy schedules and understand the importance of quick and effective workouts that can easily be added to your day. 
            That is why we have developed a free solution to manage your workouts at home.
            Instead of repeating the same workout videos, you can manage your own variety of workouts using our simple to use website.
            We believe Validus (Latin word meaning strong), will not only help you gain physical strength, 
            but give you a strong grip on a manageable and unique at home fitness routine.
            </h3>
